# CleanReceipt

This is the source code for Clean Receipt, an Android application that was created by myself, Ryan Dunn, and Erica Pantoja.
This application aims to make life easier when it comes to budgeting and storing receipts.
You can create your own monthly budget with categories and everytime you upload or take a picture of a receipt, it will automatically be scanned
for its information (address, price paid, date) and your budget will automatically update depending on the price you paid and category you chose.
